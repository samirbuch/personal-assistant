## Conference Call Feature

See [Conference Feature Documentation](docs/CONFERENCE_FEATURE.md) for detailed information.

**Quick usage**: During any call, the caller can say "I'd like to speak with a human" and the AI will add you to the call as a 3-way conference. The AI then intelligently stays silent during human-to-human conversation but responds when directly addressed.

See [Quick Start Guide](docs/CONFERENCE_QUICK_START.md) for setup and usage.
